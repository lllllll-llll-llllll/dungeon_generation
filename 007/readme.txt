dungeon_gen_7
  prefab file data structure changed to accomate more things down the line
  prefab rooms have a percent chance of placement, letting their frequency be tweaked
  max distance between rooms now configurable, uses a different method than before too
  the 0,0 black pixel bug for outputs is somehow fixed
  
  there isn't much of a difference between 6 and 7
  
  the lack of a max distance really made 6's outputs look strange though, the hallways were way too long. this is way better i think. and the changes to how data in the prefab.txt is stored will make it easier to do things in the future
