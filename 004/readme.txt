dungeon_gen_4 through 4.1

basic idea:
  - fresh start
  - keep the good ideas from 1/2/3
  - keep code from becoming confusing

result:
  - it had strange output initially, to see what i mean
    you can check the 4-1, 4-2, etc images prior to 4.1
  - i must have had lots of things implemented incorrectly
    but gradually everything was fixed.
  - 4.1 will generate a bunch of rooms that are always connected
    and it is quite tunable. i will consider this the first
    successful dungeon generator i've made.
