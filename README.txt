mathematically illiterate dungeon generation tests

the code is a mess and only included for my convenience so i have everything documented.
the only things worth checking out are probably just the output pictures, and perhaps reading the readmes for each test.

species:
a: 1--2--3--3.1
       \
        4--4.1--5
b: 6
