dungeon gen 6

this uses the same approach as the previous, but it was largely rewritten. instead of randomly sized rooms, we have a variety of prefabs that we create ourselves stores in prefabs.txt which it will draw as rooms for us. the rooms contain height/width info, and each space is either empty, floor, or a door. so we pick a random prefab, place it, and ake connections between the doors of the nearest room, then repeat until we fail enough times or reach the room limit

it produces interesting output. it is cool to see little buildings i have created get placed down. i will need to add in the minimum distance check so rooms arent placed too far apart. sometimes the rooms create islands and don't connect. i plan on visually stepping through the process and looking at output from each step to see how and why this occurs, the method for producing output from each step was created previously so i can modify that. the first space of the array is also colored black for all the output which is weird. i think the problem occurs early on, when there are no other rooms or something around that period.
