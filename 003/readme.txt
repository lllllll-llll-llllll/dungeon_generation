dungeon_gen_3

basic idea:
	- quickly add a connection_distance_max check into dungeon_gen_2 when placing rooms
	- this was supposed to make the map more dense and have less hallways 
	
result:
	- the map isn't any denser and the hallways are more or less the same.
	- in addition, the rooms generate in a "\" diagonal orientation which is strange.	
	- output is still pretty interesting
	
what i learned:
	- i need to redo this and start over for dungeon_gen_4, but try to implement everything
	  i've learned from 1/2/3 into 4.
