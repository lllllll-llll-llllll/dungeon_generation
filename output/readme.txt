sample output from my scripts goes here.

output is named according to the script name,
ie. 2-1, 2-2, 2-3 are all outputs from dungeon_gen_2.

the output is text, but was edited in paint.net to produce these images.
this was done because there are connection issues with the room and
color-coding the sections helps identify the disconnected 'islands' of rooms.
